# Fixerapp

Welcome to the front-end of my full-stack web app, Fixerapp! The purpose of this app is to demonstrate my work as a software developer.
The main feature of this app is called "Quick Fix". The idea is for homeowners to be able to find/hire repair professionals,
and repair professionals to find work, in a more convenient way. In order to access this you must create an account and sign in.
I recommend creating both a "client" and "fixer" account, and trying the Quick Fix feature with two windows (or two separate devices). Refresh tokens are sent via httpOnly cookies, so you must
be in a separate session to use the accounts at the same time.

You do not need to use a real email address or any of your personal information when creating an account (e.g., feel free to use an email@example.com type format). If this were a commercial application I would add email verification, as well as Google Sign-In, but I'd like people to feel comfortable to try it out without entering personal info! The actual feature should be pretty self-explanatory: once logged in on the client/fixer accounts, simply go to Quick Fix and click "Find Fixer"/"Find Work" in an area of your choice.
The searches are primarily filtered by geographical location (additional filters may be added in the future), so you must be within either 20 (or 40 miles) of a client/fixer, depending on your settings. There are additional separate features that may also be added later, including a proposal/bid system that would be for more extensive jobs.
